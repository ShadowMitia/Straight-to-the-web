# Straight to the web

## About

Forces all Google searches to use the new 'Web' mode by appending links with "udm=14". This effectively disables AI suggestions and widgets (such as calculator, etc), to only give you search results without the fluff.

This won't improve search results, but should give you a better access to the information you are actually looking for.
